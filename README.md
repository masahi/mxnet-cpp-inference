Test model loading and inference with MXNet C++ API.

I couldn't get the official example [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/cpp-package/example/feature_extract/feature_extract.cpp) working, so I made this repo.
Hope this will be useful to someone who needs to do C++ only deploy.

You need to download some data from [my google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=102Xbs16qjopN9Tllgaqb06jWwH7zjRx1) to run examples.
